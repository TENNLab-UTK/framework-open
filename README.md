# What This Repo Contains

This repo contains the following:

- Simulator for the RISP neuroprocessor.
- `network_tool`: A command-line tool for creating and manipulating spiking neural networks,
  including those for the RISP neuroprocessor.
- `processor_tool_risp`: Command-line tool for simulating the RISP neuroprocessor running networks.
- Spiking neural network format definition.
- C++ `Network` class with supporting methods for creating and manipulating networks.
- C++ `Processor` interface, for applications (like the `processor_tool`) that employ spiking
  neural networks and neuroprocessors.  The RISP simulator implements this interface, but the
  inteface allows for multiple neuroprocessor implementations.

-----------------
# The RISP Neuroprocessor

This is an extremely simple spiking neuroprocessor.  It features leaky integrate-and-fire
neurons and synapses with integer delays.  Its simplicity facilitates efficient implementations,
and there are implementations for RISP in CPU simulation, microcontrollers, and FPGA's.
Here are some links about RISP:

- [The Case for RISP: A Reduced Instruction Spiking Processor](https://neuromorphic.eecs.utk.edu/publications/2022-06-29-the-case-for-risp-a-reduced-instruction-spiking-processor/), a paper describing RISP.
- [The RISP Markdown In This Repo](markdown/risp.md).
- [The VRISP Vectorized Version of RISP](markdown/vrisp.md)
- [Open-Source FPGA Implementation of RISP](https://github.com/TENNLab-UTK/fpga).

# Getting Started

To get started with this repo, please do one or both of:

- Go through the [Getting Started](markdown/getting_started.md) markdown file.  This has
  a step-by-step walkthrough of using the various tools in this repo.
- Watch the [Getting Started](https://youtu.be/xDIwA5ie15E) video.  This is a video where I go through the 
  [Getting Started](markdown/getting_started.md) markdown file.  This allows you to go through
  the steps of learning this software with me explaining as we go.

After that, you should:

- Go through the [Network Tool](markdown/network_tool.md) markdown file (which has its own video).
- Go through the [RISP](markdown/risp.md) markdown file (which also has its own video). 

By the end of this exercise, you should be equipped with the know-how and tools to start creating
and running your own RISP networks, and to start exploring embedded applications with the
[Open-Source FPGA Implementation of RISP](https://github.com/TENNLab-UTK/fpga).

Also, you may want to try [vrisp](markdown/vrisp.md), as its simulator is faster than the
original RISP simulator.

# Documentation

In addition to the material above, 
documentation of everything in this repo is in the [markdown](markdown) directory.
You can typically find what you want there, including information on C++ support if you
want to leverage this software from C++.

-----------------
# "I don't want to touch C++"

You don't have to.  

Although all of the code in this repo is written in C++, your two main tools,
the `network_tool` and `processor_tool`, are command-line tools.  You may interact with them as
command-line programs, and they fit really well with shell scripts and other programming
environments.  So please go through "Getting Started" below -- you don't have to touch any C++.

Now, there is C++ support for network manipulation and for the RISP neuroprocessor.  I suspect
the users for this support are rare, but it is there, and we have it documented.

# Support for Python

To implement this framework in Python, see the [Python Build](markdown/python_build.md) markdown file.
